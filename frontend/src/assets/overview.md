Welcome to this web-based platform dedicated to shake table tests conducted on unreinforced masonry buildings!

This database of shake table tests conducted on full URM buildings aims to contribute with an open-access web-based interactive platform that serves as the first centralized database for this type of test.

The platform is organized in a consistent format, making it easy to obtain specific information and test results. Furthermore, you will be able to download relevant data and ready-to-use numerical models for modeling validation and uncertainty quantification studies in the seismic assessment of URM buildings.

Thanks for your interest and please join us on our mission to bolster earthquake resilience and deepen our understanding of these amazing structures, paving the way for safer communities and more resilient infrastructure.
